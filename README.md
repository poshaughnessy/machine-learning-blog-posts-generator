# Machine Learning generated blog post titles

I thought I'd try out `textgenrnn` with our Samsung Internet blog post titles. (I also tried it out for [Pavement lyrics](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/machine-learning-lyrics-generator)).

## Instructions

```
pip3 install textgenrnn
pip3 install tensorflow
python3 run.py
```

## Example output

Here are some of the new blog posts titles that it's generated ðŸ˜†

```
Introducing Disconnect for SamsungInternet
Perfectionism, anxiety and advertising on the web
Making a community malicious web sites
Hello Samsung Internet for SamsungInternet
```

## Credits

Uses [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn) which uses [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
