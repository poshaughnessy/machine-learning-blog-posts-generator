# Machine Learning blog posts test with textgenrnn

I thought I'd also try out textgenrnn with our Samsung Internet blog post titles.

## Instructions

```
pip3 install textgenrnn
pip3 install tensorflow
python3 run.py
```

## Example output

Here are some of the new blog posts titles that it's generated ðŸ˜†

```
