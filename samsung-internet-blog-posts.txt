As holiday shopping season is approaching fast, we are very excited to announce Quick Suggest, a shopping assistant built right into Samsung Internet browser.
Coming up on two years ago, I attended EMF Camp, ‘a non-profit UK camping festival for those with an inquisitive mind or an interest in making things’, the best way I can describe it is ‘It’s like Glastonbury for nerds’. One of the many incredible pieces on display was a giant inflatable rabbit, that you could change the colour of by tweeting.
Featuring the improvements from the 7.4 Beta, including special news and shopping additions in the US
Frameworks like Angular, React and Ember are par-for-the-course for complex web development these days. Over this decade (Angular was first released in 2010) they have grown to become defacto standards for many of us, helping countless organisations to structure their code, manage state and build complex UIs, based on reusable components.
Good news! Since v8 of Samsung Internet, now available in Beta, it is possible to automate the browser using ChromeDriver, the Selenium WebDriver protocol implementation for Chromium browsers.
I love the internet. By visiting a URL I can have access to information, learn new skills, interact with friends, shop, watch movies, play games, you name it. Not only that but new APIs are constantly being created to allow us to interact with the web in new and exciting ways.
Just over a week ago I rolled out the camping gear to join friends & colleagues at a Tech Festival in the gorgeous setting of Eastnor Castle in the UK. This festival is called Electromagnetic Field (EMF) and it runs every two years, much to the delight of many tech communities across the world.
News Push, Be the First to Know
Starting off with our series of Create conference videos are the keynotes from the event. There is really no better way to set the theme of a conference and inspire attendees than with a good opening keynote. At the Create conference, we were fortunate to have the following keynote speakers.
The next major version of Samsung’s browser for Android is now being released for beta testing
This is my first week at Samsung; I’ve done my induction, been shown the fire exits and been given a desk — it’s official! I’m joining the Samsung Internet Web Developer Advocacy team for a six month internship and cannot wait to get started in my first “tech” industry role.
